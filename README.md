# Civ a Little - Civ 6 Notifier and Webviewer

This application does as so many have done before it but decides to extend it further. The Civ 6 webhook does a POST with the infamous JSON, e.g. `'{"value1":"TestGame","value2":"TestUser","value3":"1"}'`. This application intends to record that data and expose it in different human readable formats as well as use it for statistical analysis.

Work in progress.
